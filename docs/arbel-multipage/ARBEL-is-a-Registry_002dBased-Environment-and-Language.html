<p>ARBEL is a Registry-Based Environment and Language. A <em>registry</em> is a data structure where data is located at &quot;registers&quot;.  The data in the registers can be other registries or numbers or strings or code.  It is what other languages might call a <em>map</em> or a (hash) <em>table</em>.  Registries are the fundamental data type of ARBEL and the language provides many operations to manipulate and recover values from the registries.  ARBEL instructions operate <em>within</em> a certain registry.  The <em>environment</em> (which registers you can access, and so, which objects and instructions are available) is determined by which registry ARBEL is currently operating within.  Instructions themselves are nothing more than a way to create a new (temporary) registry, execute some code inside of it, and write results to the current registry.  
</p>
<p>From this basic, but flexible, data type ARBEL builds up a useful system for interactively constructing programs.  It&rsquo;s goal is to be easy to use interactively for building <em>personal</em> programs (programs primarily for the user&rsquo;s own use) which is why the syntax is very similar to entering commands on the command line.  There are commands to save the code you have already entered so that you can interactively build scripts.  It also has commands that make it easy to save state and the registries that you have created to disk so that you can pick up where you left off.
