<p>ARBEL&rsquo;s first distinguishing feature is that it is <em>naturally generic</em>.  What this means is that any non-literal in an instruction can be replaced by the user without the author of the instruction anticipating that it would be useful for the user to replace that part of the instruction.  This allows the user a large degree of control over code that other&rsquo;s have written.  This works because instructions in ARBEL do not really take &quot;arguments&quot; like in other languages, they take &quot;environments&quot; (registries) that put different values at different registers.  Because every aspect of the environment can be replaced, instructions are naturally generic.
</p>
<p>ARBEL&rsquo;s second main distinguishing feature is that it uses different parenthesis types (&lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>{}</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>[]</samp>&rsquo;) to control when substatements are evaluated.  Open parenthesis (&lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo;) quote a set of instructions so that they can be executed in another registry besides the one that is currently being used.  Closed parenthesis (&lsquo;<samp>[]</samp>&rsquo;) execute the substatement immediately, as if it were entered as a previous statement.  Curly parenthesis (&lsquo;<samp>{}</samp>&rsquo;) execute the substatement only if the instructruction containing it, tries to access its value.
</p>
<p>The other feature of Arbel is that it is not only a <em>language</em>, it is also an <em>environment</em>. It can be used interactively and its state can be written to disk so you can pick up where your left off or store commonly used instructions for later use.  This was one of my main motivations for writing the language: to create a general purpose language that is easy to use interactively and where it is easy to save state so that it can be used to do personal programming: interact with the computer with the power of a full programming language.  
</p>
<p>The language is dynamically-typed (registers do not have types, only the values entered in the registries do), and it is strongly typed (values have a certain type and cannot be coerced to other types except explicitly).
</p>
<p>The best way to get a feel for the language and environment is by example so&hellip;
