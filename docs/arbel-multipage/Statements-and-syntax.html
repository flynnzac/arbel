<h3 class="section">2.1 Statements and syntax</h3>

<p>A single line of ARBEL code is a statement.  The first element of the statement is one of ARBEL&rsquo;s operators and the other elements are arguments to the operator.  Statements, like sentences, end with periods. For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">... set /hello &quot;Hello, world!&quot; .
</pre></div>


<p>&lsquo;<samp>set</samp>&rsquo; is the ARBEL operation to set a register to a certain value.  Names that have a forward slash (â€‹<em>) preceeding them are /registers</em>, like &lsquo;<samp>/hello</samp>&rsquo; above. Strings are words enclosed in double quotation marks.  The following demonstrates the other data types in ARBEL:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">... set /days-in-week 7 .
... set /penny 0.01 .
... set /facts True .
... set /lies False .
... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
</pre></div>

<p>An Integer is a number without a decimal part, a Real is a number with a decimal part, a Boolean value is either True or False, an Instruction is a collection of one or more statements quoted as code (usually created by enclosing code with open parenthesis, &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;).  Instructions can be executed later inside registries perhaps different than the registries in which they were initially defined.
</p>
<p>To use the value located in a registry, simply type the name of the register without the preceeding forward slash.  For example,
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... print days-in-week .
7
</pre></div>

<p>All code elements must be separated by whitespace in ARBEL including the period that ends the statement and parenthesis.  So it would <em>not</em> be valid to write,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">' All are WRONG:
print days-in-week.
set /add-one (add t 1 .) .
</pre></div>

<p>There must be whitespace before the period.  There also must be whitespace after and before parenthesis. 
</p>
<p>There are three parenthesis types in ARBEL: open parentheis (&quot;()&quot;), closed parenthesis (&quot;[]&quot;), and curly parenthesis (&quot;{}&quot;).  All contain statements, but they differ in <em>when</em> the statements they contain are executed.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Open parenthesis store the code itself as an Instruction object to be executed later using the operation &lsquo;<samp>call</samp>&rsquo;.  For example,
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
... call add-one /t 10 .
ans = 11
</pre></div>

<p>&lsquo;<samp>call</samp>&rsquo; takes an instruction and then assigns each of the registers that you specify to different values. You do not need to declare what arguments a function takes and you can specify any number of registers to set for any Instruction.  For example, 
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
... call add-one /t 10 .
ans = 11
... call add-one /t 10 /add sub .
ans = 9
</pre></div>

<p>This is a defining feature of ARBEL. Code is naturally generic. Any object in an instruction can be replaced by any other (except for a literal value like &lsquo;<samp>11</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>&quot;hello&quot;</samp>&rsquo; ) when the Instruction is called.  The person who wrote the code does not need to do anything to allow this.  You can redefine any non-literal in the code by adding &lsquo;<samp>/name value</samp>&rsquo; in the call to the Instruction.
</p>
<p>Because there is no ambiguity, you do not actually need to use the &lsquo;<samp>call</samp>&rsquo; operation directly.  ARBEL will insert it for you if the first argument is an instruction.  So the following would work as well,
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... add-one /t 10 .
ans = 11
</pre></div>

<p>Instruction objects can also be used in the &lsquo;<samp>while</samp>&rsquo; looping operation and in several other operations.  Their main purpose is to be evaluated later in a potentially different and separate registry.
</p>
</li><li> Closed parenthesis (&quot;[]&quot;) execute the statements inside of them immediately and evaluate to whatever the code sets the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to.  The purpose of these statements is to avoid needing to define temporary registers for intermediate calculations.  For example,
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">... add [ sub 5 3 . ] [ mul 2 3 . ] .
ans = 8
</pre></div>

<p>You may have noticed the &lsquo;<samp>ans = ...</samp>&rsquo; after entering a lot of these commands.  This tells you the current value of the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register which is special in ARBEL.  Operations often write to the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register in the registry from which they are called.  It is the way to &quot;return&quot; values after calling an operation or instruction.  You can set any value to the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register in the current registry by using the &lsquo;<samp>answer</samp>&rsquo; operation.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... answer 10 .
ans = 10
</pre></div>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register is special because, after an Instruction finishes running in its temporary registry, whatever the value at the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register is in that registry is moved to the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register in the registry that called the instruction.  For example,
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... set /add-one ( answer [ add t 1 . ] . ) .
... add-one /t 10 .
ans = 11
... print ans .
11
</pre></div>

<p>The other reason that the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register is special is, as mentioned, closed parenthesis evaluate to the value the statements inside them set the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to.  Because &lsquo;<samp>subtract 5 3 .</samp>&rsquo; sets the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>multiply 2 3 .</samp>&rsquo; sets the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to &lsquo;<samp>6</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>add [ subtract 5 3 . ] [ multiply 2 3 . ] .</samp>&rsquo; sets the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to &lsquo;<samp>8</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</li><li> Curly parenthesis (&quot;{}&quot;) also enclose statements, but those statements are only evaluated <em>if</em> we try to use the value of that expression which is, like for the closed parenthesis, the value the statements set the &lsquo;<samp>/ans</samp>&rsquo; register to.  This form of evaluation is often called &quot;lazy evaluation&quot;. We can think of closed parenthesis as marking expressions we want to &quot;greedily evaluate&quot; and curly parenthesis as marking expressions to &quot;lazily evaluate&quot;.  Lazy evaluation is useful for the &lsquo;<samp>if</samp>&rsquo; operation and other, similar instructions.  For example,
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"> ... set /gt-4
 (
   set /str-t [ to-string t . ] . 
   if [ gt t 4 . ]
      { print [ string-append str-t &quot; is greater than 4.\n&quot; . ] . }
      { print [ string-append str-t &quot; is less than or equal to 4.\n&quot; . ] . } .
 ) .
... gt-4 /t 10 .
10 is greater than 4.
... gt-4 /t 3 .
3 is less than or equal to 4.
</pre></div>

<p>It works this way because the &lsquo;<samp>if</samp>&rsquo; operation returns the second value if the first value is &lsquo;<samp>True</samp>&rsquo; and the third value if the first value is &lsquo;<samp>False</samp>&rsquo;.  So it tries to access the second value when &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp>10</samp>&rsquo;, executing the statements in the second argument, and similarly for the third argument when &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; is &lsquo;<samp>3</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If we had instead used closed parenthesis, both statements would execute everytime regardless of the the truth of the first argument to &lsquo;<samp>if</samp>&rsquo;.  If we used open parenthesis, an Instruction object would be returned instead of actually doing the printing (the instruction object could be called to actually do the print later).
</p></li></ul>


<p>The last syntax element is the comment.  To write a comment in ARBEL, use a single quote (&lsquo;<samp>'</samp>&rsquo;) as the first character in a statement.  You can think about this quote as an a special operator.  Comments end with a new line. The comment operator, like other syntax elements, needs whitespace after it, for example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">... ' This is a correct comment
... 'This is an incorrect comment, 'This is interpreted as a reference to data in the Register /'This
</pre></div>

<p>That is really it as far as syntax is concerned.  Periods terminate statements, parenthesis enclose statements controlling when they are executed, and registers start with a forward slash and their values are obtained by omitting the slash.  We now also know how to define our own instructions and how to call them and how to prepare statements for greedy or lazy evaluation.
