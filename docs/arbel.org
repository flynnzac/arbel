#+DESCRIPTION: ARBEL is a registry-based environment and language. It is "generic-by-default" and is centered around a single flexible data structure: the registry (a hash table).  This manual describes how to use the language.

* Introduction
** ARBEL is a Registry-Based Environment and Language

   ARBEL is a Registry-Based Environment and Language. A /registry/ is a data structure where data is located at "registers".  The data in the registers can be other registries or numbers or strings or code.  It is what other languages might call a /map/ or a (hash) /table/.  Registries are the fundamental data type of ARBEL and the language provides many operations to manipulate and recover values from the registries.  

   ARBEL /instructions/ are like procedures in other languages, but they operate within a programmer-supplied registry and have no environment or context themselves.  This enables the programmer calling the instruction to decide which arguments it has, not the author of the instruction. The /environment/ (which registers you can access, and so, which objects and instructions are available) is determined by which registry ARBEL is currently operating within.  

   The ARBEL system's goal is to be easy to use for interactively constructing /personal/ programs for the user that are easy to read. For this reason, as much as possible, design decisions such as how generic an instruction is left to the person calling an instruction, not the person writing it. 

   The interactive nature of ARBEL is reflected in its syntax and environment. The syntax is very similar to entering commands on the command line (it has a bit of a TCL flavor visually, but the semantics of the language are very different). The enviroment is focused on being easy to save and load state.   There are commands to save the code you have already entered so that you can interactively build scripts.  It also has commands that make it easy to save state and the registries that you have created to disk so that you can pick up where you left off.  

   The syntax of ARBEL allows for a style of programming that may be easier to read for non-programmers.  For example, the following is a valid block of ARBEL code using a user-defined instruction called =prepare= presumably defined elsewhere:
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... prepare /document "report" /from "2020-01-01" /to "2020-03-31" .
   #+END_SRC

   The reader of the code does not need to understand the order the arguments are in.  The writer of this code may in fact be a non-programmer just 
using the =prepare= instruction written by someone else, in much the same way as a command-line program.  The reader of the code can be pretty sure what the line of code does without any programming knowledge.  For this reason, ARBEL may also be useful for producing business programs that are readable by people who are not primarily programmers.  

** Distinguishing Features

   ARBEL's first distinguishing feature is that it is as generic as the caller of the instruction wants it to be, not the programmer of the instruction.  What this means is that any non-literal in an instruction can be replaced by the user without the author of the instruction anticipating that it would be useful for the user to replace that part of the instruction.  This allows the user a large degree of control over code that other's have written.  This works because instructions in ARBEL do not really take "arguments" like in other languages, they take "environments" (registries) that put different values at different registers.  Because every aspect of the environment can be replaced, instructions are naturally generic.

   ARBEL's second main distinguishing feature is that it uses different parenthesis types (=()=, ={}=, and =[]=) to control when substatements are evaluated.  Open parenthesis (=()=) quote a set of instructions so that they can be executed in another registry besides the one that is currently being used.  Closed parenthesis (=[]=) execute the substatement immediately, as if it were entered as a previous statement.  Curly parenthesis (={}=) execute the substatement only if the instructruction containing it, tries to access its value.

   The other feature of Arbel is that it is not only a /language/, it is also an /environment/. It can be used interactively and its state can be written to disk so you can pick up where your left off or store commonly used instructions for later use.  This was one of my main motivations for writing the language: to create a general purpose language that is easy to use interactively and where it is easy to save state.

   The language is dynamically-typed (registers do not have types, only the values entered in the registries do), and it is strongly typed (values have a certain type and cannot be coerced to other types except explicitly).

   The best way to get a feel for the language and environment is by example so...

* The Language
** Statements and syntax

   A single line of ARBEL code is called a statement.  The first element of the statement is one of ARBEL's /operators/ and the other elements are arguments to the operator.  Statements, like sentences, end with periods. For example,
  
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... set /hello "Hello, world!" .
   #+END_SRC
    

   =set= is the default location of the ARBEL operation to set a register to a certain value.  The above code sets the register =/hello= to the String value ="Hello, world!=. Names that have a forward slash (â€‹/) preceeding them are /registers/, like =/hello= above. Strings are words enclosed in double quotation marks.  The following demonstrates the other data types in ARBEL:

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... set /days-in-week 7 .
   ... set /penny 0.01 .
   ... set /facts True .
   ... set /lies False .
   ... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
   #+END_SRC

   An Integer is a number without a decimal part, a Real is a number with a decimal part, a Boolean value is either True or False, an Instruction is a collection of one or more statements quoted as code (usually created by enclosing code with open parenthesis, "(" and ")").  Instructions can be executed later inside registries perhaps different than the registries in which they were initially defined.

   To use the value located in a registry, simply type the name of the register without the preceeding forward slash.  For example,
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
  ... print days-in-week .
  7
   #+END_SRC

   All code elements must be separated by whitespace in ARBEL including the period that ends the statement and parenthesis.  So it would /not/ be valid to write,

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
	' All are WRONG:
	print days-in-week.
	set /add-one (add t 1 .) .
   #+END_SRC

   There must be whitespace before the period.  There also must be whitespace after and before parenthesis. 

   There are four parenthesis types in ARBEL: open parentheis ("()"), closed parenthesis ("[]"), curly parenthesis ("{}"), and angle brackets ("<>").  The first three all contain groups of statements, but they differ in /when/ the statements they contain are executed.  The angle brackets are used for defining new operations from instructions.
   
   - Open parenthesis store the code itself as an Instruction object to be executed later using the operation =call=.  For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
     ... call add-one /t 10 .
     ans = 11
     #+END_SRC

     =call= takes an instruction and then assigns each of the registers that you specify to different values. You do not need to declare what arguments a function takes and you can specify any number of registers to set for any Instruction.  For example, 
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
     ... call add-one /t 10 .
     ans = 11
     ... call add-one /t 10 /add sub .
     ans = 9
     #+END_SRC

     This is a defining feature of ARBEL. Code is naturally generic. Any object in an instruction can be replaced by any other (except for a literal value like =11= or ="hello"= ) when the Instruction is called.  The person who wrote the code does not need to do anything to allow this.  You can redefine any non-literal in the code by adding =/name value= in the call to the Instruction.

     Because there is no ambiguity, you do not actually need to use the =call= operation directly.  ARBEL will insert it for you if the first argument is an instruction.  So the following would work as well,
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... add-one /t 10 .
     ans = 11
     #+END_SRC

     Instruction objects can also be used in the =while= looping operation and in several other operations.  Their main purpose is to be evaluated later in a potentially different and separate registry.

   - Closed parenthesis ("[]") execute the statements inside of them immediately and evaluate to whatever the code sets the =/ans= register to.  The purpose of these statements is to avoid needing to define temporary registers for intermediate calculations.  For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... add [ sub 5 3 . ] [ mul 2 3 . ] .
     ans = 8
     #+END_SRC

     You may have noticed the =ans = ...= after entering a lot of these commands.  This tells you the current value of the =/ans= register which is special in ARBEL.  Operations often write to the =/ans= register in the registry from which they are called.  It is the way to "return" values after calling an operation or instruction.  You can set any value to the =/ans= register in the current registry by using the =answer= operation.
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... answer 10 .
     ans = 10
     #+END_SRC

     The =/ans= register is special because, after an Instruction finishes running in its temporary registry, whatever the value at the =/ans= register is in that registry is moved to the =/ans= register in the registry that called the instruction.  For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... add 10 12 .
     ans = 22
     ... set /add-one ( add t 1 . ) .
     ... add-one /t 10 .
     ans = 11
     ... print ans .
     11
     #+END_SRC

     The other reason that the =/ans= register is special is, as mentioned, closed parenthesis evaluate to the value the statements inside them set the =/ans= register to.  Because =subtract 5 3 .= sets the =/ans= register to =2= and =multiply 2 3 .= sets the =/ans= register to =6=, =add [ subtract 5 3 . ] [ multiply 2 3 . ] .= sets the =/ans= register to =8=.

   - Curly parenthesis ("{}") also enclose statements, but those statements are only evaluated /if/ we try to use the value of that expression which is, like for the closed parenthesis, the value the statements set the =/ans= register to.  This form of evaluation is often called "lazy evaluation". We can think of closed parenthesis as marking expressions we want to "greedily evaluate" and curly parenthesis as marking expressions to "lazily evaluate".  Lazy evaluation is useful for the =if= operation and other, similar instructions.  For example,
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... set /gt-4
     (
       set /str-t [ to-string t . ] . 
       if [ gt t 4 . ]
          { print [ string-append str-t " is greater than 4.\n" . ] . }
          { print [ string-append str-t " is less than or equal to 4.\n" . ] . } .
     ) .
    ... gt-4 /t 10 .
    10 is greater than 4.
    ... gt-4 /t 3 .
    3 is less than or equal to 4.
     #+END_SRC

     It works this way because the =if= operation returns the second value if the first value is =True= and the third value if the first value is =False=.  So it tries to access the second value when =t= is =10=, executing the statements in the second argument, and similarly for the third argument when =t= is =3=.

     If we had instead used closed parenthesis, both statements would execute everytime regardless of the the truth of the first argument to =if=.  If we used open parenthesis, an Instruction object would be returned instead of actually doing the printing (the instruction object could be called to actually do the print later).

   - Angle brackets (<>) transform an instruction into an operation.  Instructions are code blocks formed using open parenthesis =()= that operate within whatever registry the caller of the instruction defines.  Operations execute with a fixed set of positional arguments determining the registry the code executes in.  All of the built-in features of the language are operations, but most programmer-defined code is an instruction.  Occasionally, it is useful to transform instructions into operations.  This transformation is a lot like a procedure definition in other languages. Angle brackets or the =op= operation provide two alternative ways of doing this.

     For example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
     ... set /fraction ( div t1 [ add t1 t2 . ] . ) .
     ... fraction /t1 1 /t2 3.0 .
     ans = 0.25
     ... [ op fraction /t1 /t2 . ] 1 3.0 .
     ans = 0.25
     ... < fraction /t1 /t2 > 1 3.0 .
     ans = 0.25
     ... set /op-fraction < fraction /t1 /t2 > .
     ... op-fraction 1 3.0 .
     ans = 0.25
     ... < fraction /t2 /t1 > 1 3.0 .
     ans = 0.75
     #+END_SRC

     Note that there is no period used to end an operation definition in the angle brackets. The brackets call the instruction =fraction= and sets the register =/t1= to the value of the first argument and the register =/t2= to the second argument.  The order would be switched if we had instead used: =< fraction /t2 /t1 >=.

   The last syntax element is the comment.  To write a comment in ARBEL, use a single quote (='=) as the first character in a statement.  You can think about this quote as an a special operator.  Comments end with a new line. The comment operator, like other syntax elements, needs whitespace after it, for example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... ' This is a correct comment
   ... 'This is an incorrect comment, 'This is interpreted as a reference to data in the Register /'This
   #+END_SRC

   That is really it as far as syntax is concerned.  Periods terminate statements, parenthesis enclose statements controlling when they are executed, and registers start with a forward slash and their values are obtained by omitting the slash.  We now also know how to define our own instructions and how to call them and how to prepare statements for greedy or lazy evaluation.

** Registries

   In ARBEL, most of the action happens inside /registries/.  Registries are both data structures and define what registers (variables) are in scope.  Code is always execute "inside" a registry. Because registries are full fledged data structures, you can switch scope easily or even pass a scope as an argument. When you start the interpreter, you are already inside the default, top-level registry.  To create a new one, use the =registry= operation,

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... registry /hello "Hello, world!" /x 10 .
   #+END_SRC

   The =registry= operation puts a new registry in the =/ans= register.  This registry has a =/hello= register bound to the value ="Hello, world!"= and with the =/x= register bound to the value =10=.  Usually, you will want to bind the value to another register besides =/ans= which will be overwritten by subsequent statements. You can do either of:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... registry /hello "Hello, world!" /x 10 .
   ... move /ans /my-registry .
   ... ' Or:
   ... set /my-registry [ registry /hello "Hello, world!" /x 10 . ] .
   #+END_SRC

   To access values in a registry, you can either use the =get= operation or the "colon notation":

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... get /hello my-registry .
   ans = Hello, world!
   ... print my-registry:/hello
   Hello, world!
   ... print hello .
   Error: Value at `/hello` not found.
   #+END_SRC

   From the last line, we can see that the value =hello= exists only in the registry located at =/my-registry= which we are not currently in.  So we cannot access its =/hello= register directly.  We can change which registry we are in with the =go-in= operation.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... go-in hello .
   ... print hello .
   Hello, world!
   #+END_SRC

   We can go back to the registry we were in previously by using the =go-out= operation.

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... go-out .
   ... print hello 
   Error: Value at `/hello` not found.
   #+END_SRC

   We can import values from one registry into their corresponding registers in the current registry by using the =import= operation.

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... import my-registry .
   ... print hello
   Hello, world!
   #+END_SRC
   
   We can also execute an instruction inside a certain registry by using the =in= command.

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... in my-registry ( print [ string-append hello " Goodbye!" . ] . ) .
   Hello, world! Goodbye!
   #+END_SRC

   

   Aside from being a useful data structure, registries are also how ARBEL does /namespaces/.  For example,

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... set /math [ registry . ] .
   ... set /factorial
          (
            set /i 2 .
            set /prod 1 .
            while ( lt-eq i t . )
                  (
                    set /prod [ multiply i prod . ] .
                    set /i [ add i 1 . ] .
                  ) .
            answer prod .
          ) math .
   ... math:/factorial /t 5 .
   ans = 120
   #+END_SRC       

   You can assign instructions inside registries and then they can be called from that registry using the colon notation.  This code block also demonstrates that the =set= operation optionally takes a third argument: the registry in which to set the register.  When omitted, it sets the register in the current registry.

   Of course, if you don't need to worry about name collisions, you can just =import= it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
   ... import math .
   ... factorial /t 5 .
   ans = 120
   #+END_SRC

   Registries are flexible data structures.  They can be used to represent structures with multiple kinds of values (like =struct= in C).  Or they can be used as namespaces for libraries or different parts of a code base.

*** Additional details about colon notation

    The colon notation can be nested.
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
    ... set /x [ registry /y [ registry /z 10 . ] . ] .
    ... print x:/y:/z .
    10
    #+END_SRC

    It can also choose the register by referencing the value of another register.
    #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
    ... set /x [ registry /y 10 . ] .
    ... set /z /y .
    ... print x:z .
    10
    #+END_SRC

    /But/ we cannot use subexpressions in the colon notation:
    #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
    ... set /x [ registry /y 10 . ] .
    ... ' BAD! print x:[ answer /y . ] .
    #+END_SRC

** Registers   

Registers are the locations of data in Registries.  They are data themselves and can be manipulated like other data objects in ARBEL.  For example, you can set other registers to registers and use those values wherever you would use registers.

#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... set /x /y .
... print x .
/y
... set x "hello" .
... print x .
/y
... print y .
hello
#+END_SRC

You can move data between Registers with the =move= command:

#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... set /x "hello" .
... move /x /y .
... print y .
hello
... print x .
Error: Value at register /x not found.
#+END_SRC

Registers are data denoting locations so they are often useful ways to manipulate the locations of values instead of the values themselves, as with the =move= and =set= operations.

** Environment

ARBEL is not only a programming language. It is also an /environment/.  The current state of ARBEL --- the values and where they are located in the registry --- can be saved to disk and re-loaded later on, using the =save= and =load= operations.

To save the current registry to a file called /state.arb/,
#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... save "state.sarb" .
#+END_SRC

To load the registry back in:
#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... load "state.sarb" .
#+END_SRC

Optionally, a second argument can be provided to =load= to load the data into a specific registry, not just the current one.

#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... load "state.sarb" old-stuff .
#+END_SRC

Where =old-stuff= is a registry.

** Linking C code

It is possible to write ARBEL operations in C, using ARBEL's =link= operation to import the code.

The following is an example of C code.

#+INCLUDE: "../examples/link.c" src c

We then compile it into a shared object file, linking against =libarbel=.

#+INCLUDE: "../examples/link_compile.sh" src sh

The code then can be loaded into ARBEL with the =link= operation like so:

#+INCLUDE: "../examples/link.arb" src arbel

The first argument of =link= gives the shared-object file name.  The second argument gives the name of the function.  The third argument gives what the name of the ARBEL operation will be.

Now, the operation can be called in the following way:
#+BEGIN_SRC arbel
... log1 1 .
ans = 0.693147
#+END_SRC




* Reference

Arguments that are optional are enclosed in angle brackets (<>).  Operations are classified by the main data type they manipulate.

** Registry operations

*** Creation

- =registry REGISTER1 VALUE1 REGISTER2 VALUE2 ...= --- sets the =/ans= register to a registry with =VALUE1= located at =REGISTER1= and so on.

- =list VALUE1 VALUE2 ...= --- set the =/ans= register to a Registry with =VALUE1= at Register =/t1=, =VALUE2= at Register =/t2=, and so on.


*** Insert, move, and remove data to and from registers
- =set REGISTER VALUE <REGISTRY>= --- sets the value at =REGISTER= to =VALUE= in the registry =REGISTRY=.  If the =REGISTRY= argument is omitted, then it will set the register in the current registry.

- =move REGISTER1 REGISTER2= --- move the value located at =REGISTER1= to =REGISTER2=.  Does not copy the data so it is an efficient way to move data.

- =delete REGISTER= --- delete the value at =REGISTER= in the current registry.

- =free REGISTER= --- delete the value at =REGISTER= in the current registry.  Does not send the free'd data to the garbage collector but instead releases the memory immediately.  The trade-off versus =delete= is that it forces immediate removal of memory in main execution thread (which takes longer and blocks other instructions) while =delete= is faster but the memory may not be immediately removed (higher memory use).


*** Access data in Registry

- =get REGISTER <REGISTRY>= --- sets the =/ans= register to the value located at =REGISTER= in =REGISTRY=.  If the =REGISTRY= argument is not specified, get from the current registry.

- =exist REGISTER <REGISTRY>= --- set the =/ans= register to =True= if a value exists at the =REGISTER= in =REGISTRY=.  If the =REGISTRY= argument is omitted, check in the current registry.

- =import REGISTRY= --- set the Registers in the current Registry to hold the same values that they hold in REGISTRY.

- =where REGISTRY INSTRUCTION= --- set the =/ans= register to a Registry containing all the elements in the registry such that the INSTRUCTION when passed the element of the Registry at Register =/t= sets the =/ans= register to =True=.

*** Apply Operations to elements of a Registry

- =do-to-all OPERATION REGISTRY1 REGISTRY2 ... REGISTRYN= --- execute =OPERATION= which takes arguments its arguments (1...N) from each element in =REGISTRY1=, ..., =REGISTRYN=.  Sets the =/ans= register to a Registry which contains whatever the =OPERATION= evaluates to at the corresponding Registers.  For example, =do-to-all add [ list 1 2 3 . ] [ list 4 5 6 . ]= sets the =/ans= register to a Registry with elements (5,7,9) at registers =(/t1,/t2,/t3)=.  =do-to-all= will only return results at Registers that exist in all Registries.  So, for example, =do-to-all add [ list 1 2 3 . ] [ list 4 5 . ]= sets the =/ans= Register to =list 5 7=.

- =collapse OPERATION REGISTRY <STRING>= --- sets the =/ans= register to the value of applying =OPERATION= to the value in the =REGISTRY= at Register =/STRING1= and =/STRING2= and then again to the result of that and to the value of  =/STRING3= and so on. For example, =collapse add [ list 1 2 3 . ] "t"= sets the =/ans= register to =6=.  If the =STRING= argument is omitted, it is assumed to be ="t"=.


*** Execute code in a registry

- =in REGISTRY INSTRUCTION= --- call =INSTRUCTION= in =REGISTRY=.

- =go-in REGISTRY= --- make =REGISTRY= the new current registry.

- =go-out= --- leave the current Registry and move to the Registry above it.

- =up STATEMENT= --- execute STATEMENT in the registry above the current one after resolving the values of the arguments of the statement in the current registry.  For example, we can create an Instruction that can be used to increment a variable in place, like so: 
  #+BEGIN_SRC arbel
  ... set /inc ( up set x [ add 1 [ up get x . ] . ] . ) .
  ... set /x 1 . 
  ... inc /x /x . 
  ... print x .
  2
  #+END_SRC

*** Test if a registry

- =is-registry VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a Registry and to =False= otherwise.

*** Classify a registry

- =of STRING REGISTRY= --- declare REGISTRY to be =of= kind STRING.

- =is-of STRING REGISTRY= --- set the =/ans= Register to =True= if REGISTRY is of kind STRING.

- =dispatch STRING VALUE= --- set the =/ans= Register to the Instruction called STRING corresponding to VALUE.  In other words if =dispatch "f" 10=, sets the =/ans= register to Instruction at =/f+Integer=.


** Real and Integer operations

*** Arithmetic operations
- =add NUMBER1 NUMBER2 ...= --- adds all the numbers together and sets the =/ans= register to the result.

- =mul NUMBER1 NUMBER2 ...= --- multiplies all the numbers together and sets the =/ans= register to the result.

- =sub NUMBER1 NUMBER2 ...= --- subtracts the second number from the first and the third number from that and so on and sets the =/ans= register to the result. 

- =div NUMBER1 NUMBER2 ...= --- divides the first number by the second, the result by the third number, and so on and sets the =/ans= register to the result.

- =mod NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- return the remainder of dividing the first number by the second.

- =incr INTEGER1 <INTEGER2>= --- increment =INTEGER1= by =INTEGER2= or by 1 if INTEGER2 is omitted.  The difference between this operation and =add= is that it modifies =INTEGER1= in place.

- =decr INTEGER1 <INTEGER2>= --- decrement =INTEGER1= by =INTEGER2= or by 1 if INTEGER2 is omitted.  The difference between this operation and =sub= is that it modifies =INTEGER1= in place.

- =lt NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- set the =/ans= register to =True= if =NUMBER1= is less than =NUMBER2= and to =False= otherwise.

- =eq NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- set the =/ans= register to =True= if =NUMBER1= is equal to =NUMBER2= and to =False= otherwise.

- =lt-eq NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- set the =/ans= register to =True= if =NUMBER1= is less than or equal to =NUMBER2= and to =False= otherwise.

- =gt-eq NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- set the =/ans= register to =True= if =NUMBER1= is greater than or equal to =NUMBER2= and to =False= otherwise.

*** Conversion operations
- =to-number STRING|REGISTER= --- if the argument is a String, try to convert to a number and set the =/ans= Register to the result.  If the argument is a Register and ends in a number, set the =/ans= Register to the result.

- =to-real INTEGER= --- set the =/ans= Register to a Real representing the INTEGER.

*** Test if type operations
- =is-integer VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is an Integer and to =False= otherwise.

- =is-real VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a Real and to =False= otherwise.

*** Common mathematical operations
- =log NUMBER= --- set the =/ans= Register to the natural logarithm of NUMBER.

- =exp NUMBER= --- set the =/ans= Register to the NUMBER power of the natural base.

- =power NUMBER1 NUMBER2= --- set the =/ans= Register to NUMBER1 raised to the NUMBER2 power.


** Control flow operations

- =if BOOLEAN VALUE1 <VALUE2>= --- if the first argument is =True=, sets the =/ans= register to =VALUE1=, if it is =False=, sets the =/ans= register to =VALUE2=.  If =VALUE2= is omitted, do nothing if the first argument is =False=.

- =while INSTRUCTION1 INSTRUCTION2= --- Call =INSTRUCTION1= in the current Registry. If it sets its =/ans= register to =True=, call =INSTRUCTION2=.  Repeat.

- =repeat INTEGER INSTRUCTION= --- call INSTRUCTION INTEGER times.

- =please INSTRUCTION1 INSTRUCTION2= --- Call =INSTRUCTION1=.  If there is an error, then call =INSTRUCTION2=.

** Environment operations

*** Print output

- =print VALUE= --- prints =VALUE= to screen.

*** Input and output files and state

- =source STRING= --- executes ARBEL code in the file named by STRING.

- =save FILENAME= --- save the contents of the current registry to file.

- =load FILENAME= --- load the contents of a saved file into the environment.

- =output-code STRING= --- outputs the code that has been entered at the prompt so far to the file named STRING.

- =clear-code= --- clear code that has been entered so far so that the code that =output-code= outputs will be empty.

*** Interacting with the shell

- =shell STRING= --- execute the shell command STRING.

- =change-dir STRING= --- change directory to the location given in STRING.

- =current-dir= --- set the =/ans= Register to a String giving the current directory.

*** Error handling

- =error STRING <INTEGER>= --- outputs error message String and sets an error code INTEGER (if specified, otherwise, the error number is =1=).

- =is-error INSTRUCTION= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if there was an error executing the =INSTRUCTION= and to =False= otherwise.

- =push-through INSTRUCTION= --- execute each statement in =INSTRUCTION= even if there is one of the statements has an error.

** String operations

*** Access, search, and modify string elements

- =substring STRING INTEGER1 INTEGER2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to the subset of STRING where the characters included are determined by INTEGER1 and INTEGER2.  Strings are 1-indexed in ARBEL so the first character is at location 1.  If the INTEGER is less than or equal to 0, determine the location from the end of the String.  So if =INTEGER1= and =INTEGER2= are =0=, then it will set the =/ans= register to the last character in =STRING=.

- =match STRING1 STRING2 <INTEGER>= --- find occurences of regular expression STRING1 in String STRING2.  Sets the =/ans= Register to a Registry with all submatches located at the =/tN= registries.  The optional third argument gives the number of matches to return.  If =0= is provided, return all matches (default).

- =replace STRING1 STRING2 STRING3 <INTEGER>= --- set the =/ans= Register to a String formed by replacing all occurences of regular expression STRING1 with STRING2 in STRING3.  The optional fourth argument gives the number of matches to replace.  If =0=, replace all (default).

*** String properties

- =string-length STRING= --- sets the =/ans= register to the number of characters in =STRING=.

*** String comparison

- =string-eq STRING1 STRING2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the two strings are equal and to =False= otherwise.

- =string-lt STRING1 STRING2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if =STRING1= is less than =STRING2= in the sense that the ASCII characters have lower values.

- =string-gt STRING1 STRING2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if =STRING1= is greater than =STRING2= in the sense that the ASCII characters have lower values.

*** Combine strings

- =string-append STRING1 STRING2= --- sets the =/ans= register to the concatenation of the two Strings so that the resulting string is ="STRING1STRING2"=.

*** Convert to string

- =to-string INTEGER|REAL|REGISTER <INTEGER2>= --- sets the =/ans= Register to a String representing the INTEGER or REAL or REGISTER provided as the first argument.  The second argument is optional if a REAL argument is provided.  INTEGER2 gives the number of elements after the decimal point to include.  If not provided, 6 decimal places are included.

*** Test if String

- =is-string VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a String and to =False= otherwise.

*** Strings from User Input

- =input REGISTER= --- reads a line of text the user enters and sets the =/ans= Register to the result (always a String).


** Register operations

*** Operations on "list" registers

- =next REGISTER= --- if the =REGISTER= ends in a number, return the Register with that number incremented by 1.

- =previous REGISTER= --- if the =REGISTER= ends in a number, return the Register with that number minus 1.  If that would cause the number to be less than 1 set the =/ans= Register to the "first" register with that prefix so that =previous /t1 .= sets =/ans= to =/t1=.

- =last REGISTRY STRING= --- return the last Register in the =REGISTRY= that starts with =STRING=.  So that if you had registers =/x0=, =/x1=, and =/x2= in the Registry, =last REGISTRY "x"= would return =/x2=.

*** Convert to register

- =to-register STRING|INTEGER= --- sets the =/ans= register to a Register named =STRING= or to =/tINTEGER=.

*** Register comparison
- =register-eq REGISTER1 REGISTER2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the two Registers are the same and to =False= otherwise.

*** Test if a Register
- =is-register VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a Register and to =False= otherwise.

** Instruction operations

- =call INSTRUCTION REGISTER1 VALUE1 REGISTER2 VALUE2 ...= --- executes INSTRUCTION in a Registry with REGISTER1 assigned to VALUE1 and so on.

- =is-instruction VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is an Instruction and to =False= otherwise.

- =op INSTRUCTION REGISTER1 ... REGISTERN= --- set the =/ans= register to an operation that calls =INSTRUCTION= after binding =REGISTER1= to the first argument, and so on.

** File operations

- =is-file VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a File and to =False= otherwise.

- =open-text-file STRING= --- sets the =/ans= Register to a File object corresponding to the file named STRING.

- =read FILE= --- read a single character from a File object and set the =/ans= Register to that character.

- =close REGISTER= --- if a File object is located at REGISTER, close the File and remove its reference from the REGISTER.

- =read-line FILE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to the next line from FILE.

- =write STRING FILE= --- write a given STRING to FILE.

- =data STRING= --- load a saved registry in =~/.darbs/= with the extension =.darb= into the current registry. The file being loaded is: =~/.darbs/STRING.darb=.

** Boolean operations

- =is-boolean VALUE= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if the =Value= is a Boolean and to =False= otherwise.

- =and BOOLEAN1 BOOLEAN2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if BOOLEAN1 and BOOLEAN2 are =True= and to =False= otherwise.

- =or BOOLEAN1 BOOLEAN2= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if either BOOLEAN1 or BOOLEAN2 are =True= and to =False= otherwise.

- =not BOOLEAN= --- sets the =/ans= Register to =True= if BOOLEAN is =False= and to =False= otherwise.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">GNU Free Documentation License</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">Version 1.3, 3 November 2008</p>

<p> Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;
 </p><p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. PREAMBLE</h4>

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.</p>

<p>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.</p>

<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h4>

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.</p>

<p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>

<p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</p>

<p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.</p>

<p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>

<p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>

<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.</p>

<p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

<p>The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.</p>

<p>A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.</p>

<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h4>

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>

<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.</p>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h4>

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>

<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</p>

<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.</p>

<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.</p>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. MODIFICATIONS</h4>

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

<ul>


<li>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</li>

<li>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
</li>

<li>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
</li>

<li>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
</li>

<li>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</li>

<li>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</li>

<li>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</li>

<li>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
</li>

<li>I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</li>

<li>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</li>

<li>K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
</li>

<li>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</li>

<li>M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
</li>

<li>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</li>

<li>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>

<p>You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.</p>

<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>

<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h4>

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>

<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.</p>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h4>

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.</p>

<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.</p>

<h4><a name="section7"></a>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h4>

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.</p>

<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.</p>

<h4><a name="section8"></a>8. TRANSLATION</h4>

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p>

<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.</p>

<h4><a name="section9"></a>9. TERMINATION</h4>

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>

<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.</p>

<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently

<h4><a name="section10"></a>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.</p>

<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.</p>

<h4><a name="section11"></a>11. RELICENSING</h4>

<p>&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>

<p>&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.</p>

<p>&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.</p>

<p>An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>

<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>
