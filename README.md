# ARBEL

ARBEL is a programming language based on a named-list data type called a registry and instructions to modify the contents of that registry.  Data is stored at named locations in the registry called registers.  The language has a highly regular syntax where each statement is an instruction to modify the current registry or move between different registries. ARBEL is an interpreted language and much of its design is focused on being easy to use interactively.  The language contains instructions for writing the output of an interactive session out to disk enabling interactive creation of programs.
