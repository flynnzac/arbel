* Before first complete version
- [ ] Compile libraries from command line (just an option)
- [ ] Rewrite reference manual with less first draft mess, digressions
- [ ] Write a few more algorithms to decide what to add to an initial "standard library" 
  Have an "array" library for working with ordered registers and an assert command for testing
