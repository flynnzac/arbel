Probably something like

in \reg1 ( set $buffer [ get $#key1 \my-data . ] . ) $my-data \reg2 .

It's probably easier to just have

set REGISTER VALUE REGISTRY .
as an option

* TODO Consider whether want [ instruction ] to run in new registry (I think so)

* TODO Have a for loop.  It's basically just some sugar for the while statement, but do it because very common.

* TODO Add a way to call shell

Some instruction like "shell"

shell STRING .

Executes a command

returns any output as string.
